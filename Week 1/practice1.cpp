//my first prgram in c++

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    string name;
    cout << "Hello user, enter your name: ";
    cin >> name;
    cout << "Hello World!" << endl << "My name is " << name << endl;

    cout << "I am learning C++ programming language." << endl;

    int x = 2;
    int y = 3;
    int sum = x + y;
    cout << "The sum of " << x << " and " << y << " is: " << sum << endl;
    return 0;
}

//My Algorithm for file organizer

//1. Take input from user for directory path
//2. Check if the directory exists
//3. If it exists, list all files and subdirectories
//4. Allow user to select a file or directory
//5. Perform the desired operation (e.g., move, copy, delete)
//6. Confirm the operation was successful
//7. Handle any errors that may occur during the process
//8. End the program

//Note: This is a basic outline and can be expanded with more features as needed.
